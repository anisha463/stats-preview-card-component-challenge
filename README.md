## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to use CSS Flexbox while completing this challenge. It helped me to strengthen my concepts of css properties even more.

### Continued development

After completing this challenge, I will now work on strengthening flexbox and even css grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This documentation from MDN helped me to understand flexbox. It has great content. You can refer to this if you feel you are still not so comfortable with the flexbox model.
